I'm pretty sure she would not be too keen on this considering everything that has been happening however I feel that I should do this.

It's quite common that we, as normal human beings - we tend to take things for granted until it is far too late. Or the na√Øvete, thinking that we're invincible. Limits are there for a reason. We're not gods. No one has unlimited patience, strength or motivation. Some more than others. Some less than others. You get the point.

The title is apt here. She is my muse. She occupies my thoughts everyday. Good days, and bad days. Days I feel like I do not want to continue, and days when I feel like we can do it all. Through the good times, and the bad times.

Every time I say that she's beautiful or pretty, she disagrees. But I want to show that here, in my way. Her beauty. It may not be for everyone, but it is for me. It is in a way a tribute to the woman who has impacted my life in almost every conceivable way.

I am not sure whether anyone would even read this or see the images (but I guess I can do some social media-ing) but having it here feels right.

There is nothing else to say besides what I already have, and to the beautiful person that this is for, let nothing take away that beautiful smile of yours.
