I was not quite expecting to write one but perhaps I should. Do not get me wrong this is first and foremost a place for my images and the attention should be solely on them. You can call it my portfolio if you like. Instagram doesn't quite cut in terms of the resolution of the images but it serves its purpose as a quick way to show people my work.

It has been a long time coming, I have long wanted to create a site just for this. Lo and behold, here it is. There has been a lot of tinkering, and it is a work in progress so you'll see a lot of changes from now on. But generally, this is how it should look.

More photos would be uploaded eventually once I get my hands on a dedicated film scanner. Till then, enjoy what is there right now.
