description: As I have said before the lack of dedicate film scanner means that the quality of the photos are sub-par. That is in the technical sense. But there's also the aesthetic quality that we have to talk about, or rather I do. I am not quite satisfied with it. I don't quite know what to do with the existing images that I do have besides editing them the best I can and uploading them here. Of course, Instagram hides the flaws more but I suppose the whole point of having this site is to be honest about everything.
