description: It's a click-bait-y title but it's not that all inaccurate. This would be the last photo series posted for the foreseeable future, well, until I'm done with the exchange probably, and done with the portrait series. Instagram would stop for a bit as well. I have a few more photos from this series to be posted then it'll stop when I fly off this Saturday. Instagram Stories may still be a thing though, but I have to figure out where and how to edit videos in Sweden. The Android apps aren't any good, so we'll see how that goes.

Till then.
