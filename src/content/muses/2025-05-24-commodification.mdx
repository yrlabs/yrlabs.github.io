Lately I have been thinking about the idea of universal prostitution, the commodification of the self; that all labour at its core are alike, and that the only differences we assign to them are based on ethics and/or morality. That being said would I be fine with selling my body in a more direct way than I already do now? Probably not (because of the aforementioned reasons). Though I would be hypocritical to think that the extent of the energy expenditure for remuneration is not dissimilar. Oftentimes, I would think to myself; who am I doing this for, and for what?

When there's a need, there will be someone or something that comes along to fill that gap. I plug that gap in the way that I do, with flex tape. Others do it in their own way, and each person (although at the end, outcomes are pretty much indistinguishable) take different paths, and each path may take varying amounts of time to finish. Does finishing the work faster equate to better remuneration? And if you're paid the same anyway (same role), why work harder? For the potential of a promotion perhaps, or respect from your colleagues. Motivations differ.

But I digress. 

I started thinking about this more. The sense of identity one would have when they have a job. You are spending at least $\frac{1}{3}$ of your adult working life doing just that. It has to have some meaning, a greater purpose if you will, in some sense, right? Why else would certain professions demand more "respect" than others? There is the money, and money can bring prestige, and then there's just the prestige, which could also bring other benefits, by way of reputation, which could then lead back to more money.

I suppose this train of thought does dwell in the anarchist chasm, depending on what you subscribe to philosophically, there are _positive_ ways to look at this, just that I think sometimes it's a little bit too much _copium_ that we are pumping directly into our arteries, about the agency that we think we have.
