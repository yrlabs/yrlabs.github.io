description: I want to talk about actions and repercussions. How the things that we do minute to minute, day to day has quite the drastic effect on ourselves in the future, in a way that we will not be able to predict that the *minute* decisions we make, be it subconsciously or not would create such an outcome. This mentality is a double edged sword. On one hand it has allowed me the discipline and will to put forward only creative and productive actions. At the same time, it causes debilitating procrastination due to the fear of not achieving perfection. The action of grinding gears till the teeth gets worn out, and you fall apart.

I want to talk about actions and repercussions. How the things that we do minute to minute, day to day has quite the drastic effect on ourselves in the future, in a way that we will not be able to predict that the *minute* decisions we make, be it subconsciously or not would create such an outcome. This mentality is a double edged sword. On one hand it has allowed me the discipline and will to put forward only creative and productive actions. At the same time, it causes debilitating procrastination due to the fear of not achieving perfection. The action of grinding gears till the teeth gets worn out, and you fall apart.

Knowing then, how to fail, is important. Practising mistakes is important. Knowing how to account for them, how to manage them, how to get rid of them entirely (almost). This process of creative destruction (irony of this economic theory being derived from Marx), has been important in my journey thus far. But the thing that takes precedence over others is doing things for the self (mostly).

At the end of the day, no one else is playing the *game* but yourself. You cannot take what your friends say, what the radio says, what the TV says, what your parents say, and make decisions based on perspectives suited to the myopic agenda of the masses (plural of agendum). As the repercussions, good or bad, will be yours, and yours only (sure it may have negative/positive externalities as well, but the majority of the effect is on you).

I have recently had the privilege of hashing out the details of the idea of *parallels*. I have talked (or I guess, written about it) here before. Like the image above, and such is the seed, for it perfectly conceptualises (irony) the idea. 

Using the metaphor of *lines* then. Parallel lines are seen to never *meet*. But *meeting* indicates *divergence* in eventuality. In the sense of the *parallels* that I am thinking about is that the lines never really *meet* but are always *together*. In-sync. That is if we look at it within two dimensions. With the presence of the *z-axis*, do we see *convergence* and *divergence* occurring simultaneously? 

For what is one, is the other. What is the other, is all the same.

Yes, this is pretentious drivel.
