The title of my website means *journal* in Spanish. But if you look at it in English, vista means pleasing view. And the "re" means looking back, or repeating. So all in all, should be pretty self explanatory.

It is a collection of *vistas* that have happened in the past, and here we are looking back at them in retrospection. A collection of experiences that I have had, so in that way, it is a journal of my travels or of how I see things in my day to day. 

Or rather what I deem as *pleasing* to my eye, or interesting to say the least.
