We all have our own fair share of troubles but we always have to move forward. Don't get me wrong, it gets really hard sometimes. I do not need to go into details about how hard things can get.\n\nI really do like this Swedish quote I found mid of last year (more than 1.5 years ago):\n\n*Det blir som det blir.*\n\nIt literally means \"*it will be like it will be*\". Sounds a bit negative but it is very Stoic in its nature. The English interpretation is, \"*We must take things as we find them*\". Being that, we make plans not to make circumstances fit those plans, but make plans to fit those circumstances as aptly put George S. Patton in *War as I knew It* (1947).\n\nKeep busy, be productive. Idle hands are the devil's workshop (*speaking of which, I now have 8 rolls of Kodak Tri-X, 5 rolls of Cinestill 800T, and an incoming 5 rolls of Kodak Portra 160, 5 rolls of Cinestill BwXX and 5 more rolls of Cinestill 800T. Mmmm. So goood*).\n\nThat is not to say to keep busy with things that will make you regret doing the next day just because you decided to do it for the sake of doing it, to fit in or whatever lame excuse you are using to justify yourself. The moment you have to bend yourself to justify your actions, take a step back, then two, then turn around, and walk home buddy. Just go on home.\n\nJust putting it out there.

Two Five just went up today (*well just now*) as a part of a longer one. I realised it's near to impossible to sum up a three hour trip into just one 15 second video. So, breaking it up it is then.\n\nBut it quickly dawned upon me that, sure, it has been said to be too much work for 15 second videos, no one is going to see again in 24 hours (*Instagram updated it with highlights, so it's no longer that much of a problem, rather it gives more options to pick and choose what you want to post indefinitely*), it didn't really hit me till I started doing it.\n\nBoy. It really is, a lot of work.\n\nBut it's fun. And it's challenging. I'm learning as I go along. This is indeed a niche area to work on. But since I'm already on the Instagram bandwagon.

Objectivity, detaches you from it. Experience, from reflection. Connection, from empathy. Empathy, from conscious effort to understand. Understanding, requires thought, patience and time.\n\nNow that the pretentious part is done with, we can begin. (*they say writing is therapeutic, so here I am trying to keep my sanity for a little while longer*)\n\nLet's talk.\n\nSince this is a photography website or my photography portfolio or what have you. We'll talk about how I express myself through my images.\n\n(*if you care that is, continue to read*).\n\nYou'll see that the black and white ones are dark. I mean, yes, it's black and white. But it's dark. Like this one for example:\n\nAnd for colour, I tend to go for pastel or muted in the tones. Like these examples (the middle one being my favourite for both obvious and less obvious reasons):\n\nThere is a certain kind of balance required I feel. And what I think doesn't really matter. See, it's okay to be objective. And for the most part, it is desirable. What I have found best is to follow your gut or instinct or that little voice in your head. Okay, maybe not that little voice in your head.\n\nIn addition to that, as the person taking the photo, or the person writing, or experiencing a certain situation. This idiom comes to mind, \"*(right) under someone's (very) nose*\". The closer we are to something, it can be an objective even. The less we see. Myopic is a good analogy for it. So we have to take a step back right?\n\n> Now this is the hard part. \n\nI have made countless mistakes, most I can recover from. And some, I couldn't. And some, I just don't know. Those \"*some mistakes\" *are unfortunately really big ones, which they usually are. The kind that sticks with you for life, in good ways and bad, shapes you into a different kind of being or specifically person (*I'm just being species neutral here).*\n\n> Okay wait, what's the hard part? \n\nOps, got lost in my thoughts there. The hard part is actually doing it. Sounds obvious right? And half of it is actually being aware enough to catch yourself before it's too late. \n\n> How do we make it easier? \n\nHaving good friends. Now, this is subjective. But in my opinion, friends should be people who can take a step back from whatever biases (*I mean there will always be a bias*), and judge what you did. They know you well enough and aren't afraid of saying harsh things to you. I know that friends should always get your back right? Well, not always. Friends should always tell you if you're doing something wrong, or stupid and especially not leave you to your own devices when your gut can't be trusted.\n\nIt's the same reason why even Magnum photographers have editors to pick images for them. They are too close to it. It's also another reason why I tend to develop film late, or sit on it for a long period of time. (*although I should be better with developing it earlier*) I come to it with no memory or much memory of what has transpired during that shot. You can't really do that with life though, with relationships for example.\n\nWhich is why you need to have that support structure. Everyone does. Even me. There are good ones and bad ones. If you're of sane mind at this time, there's no better time than now to think about it. Constant reflection is key to self-improvement. Even if you fail again. Even if you repeat again. Reflect always.\n\nIf you don't have that support structure. Then, there's really not much *you alone* can do about it. You can try to rationalise your way out of it. Or distract yourself. But those are band-aid solutions. It has to go deeper. And few can do that alone. Try seek help. Ask for opinions. Then, just ride it out I suppose. I can't really offer any insight here. To each his own. Or her own.\n\nWhich brings us back to expression. In other words, the colour of communication. If you got that part down right, most of your problems are gone. \n\nThe rest is really up to the interpretation of the recipient. And then, you just have to accept it. \n\n> P.S: No more image posts on the site for now I think. But we'll see soon enough.

I think I get to do almost anything I want.\n\n*In perpetuum et unum diem* is where the title of this post came from. It might sound familiar, some romance films have it as their title. And it makes sense, it talks about undying devotion, well, until you're actually dead. It's a romance film, so having a romantic title fits the bill, romantic gestures. Idealism. But, it can be for yourself too. When you take away everything from a person, I believe what's left is the person's belief (*hah pun*). His/her (*I don't actually have to do this, in English, a general he/his/man is gender neutral, if I'm not mistaken*, *but you don't want SJWs coming in here*) principles. Or his/her word.\n\nOftentimes, we tend to seek extrinsic sources of motivation, something to devote ourselves to, something to give us purpose. But maybe, it should be inward instead. Don't get me wrong. Having to live for something greater than yourself is, well, amazing. But not everyone can find that. I thought I did. Maybe, I still do. But yeah, now I don't know. Hence, today we talk about intrinsic motivation, devotion, belief ladida.\n\nWhy does it have to be internal? It's hard, it's vague, it's slow. \"*Find your inner strength*\", for example, is a very vague expression. What do you even look for? Yet, those age old masters of wisdom expound this till their breath went stale.\n\nThe best analogy I can come with up with is the base load.\n\nIn electrical utility companies, they determine demand of electricity through the base load, intermediate, and peak load. Base load is something they absolutely have to be able to produce electricity at. And this is the argument against clean energy for example, since it's volatile. That's why battery technology is so important for the development of clean energy. But I digress.\n\nInternal motivations for example, is to target the base load. You can always rely on it. Because you can always rely on yourself. Unless you're mentally unstable or paraplegic. Or bipolar. But you get the point. Extrinsic motivations, are to target the peak loads, sudden bursts of energy that you can use to target those times whereby demand is spiking. Things like discipline and your principle are things that should never be able to be eroded away or changed willy-nilly. They are stable.\n\nSo, why not devote yourself to yourself. To be a better version of yourself, whatever that means to you.\n\nForever and a day.","src/content/muses/2017-12-23-forever-and-a-day.mdx","551569ddef7750e4","hiatus",{"id":229,"data":231,"body":237,"filePath":238,"digest":239,"deferredRender":22},{"title":232,"tags":233,"author":16,"description":234,"pubDate":235,"updatedDate":236},"Hiatus",[9],"It's a click-bait-y title but it's not that all inaccurate.

I have talked to the photography-in-charge of the county museum, and have seen the darkroom. It has an old school layout as pointed out by my photography teacher. It has a bunch (*a lot*) of photographic paper, some chemicals for printing but lacking on the film development front. Of which, I still have not worked out the logistics.

I have also gotten a new 50mm lens (*Carl Zeiss Planar*) for it. Has some dust specks within the lens elements but it should not be too much of a problem, I hope.

At this point, I would say that I have reached equilibrium during the time that I have spent here. Consequently, the disquiet, and the need for isolation becomes more apparent.\n\nThere are some changes, not to say the least, regarding my emotional and mental state. However physically I have, for the better at least. School for the most part remains as unchallenging as it always has been. More and more I feel that it is failing to serve its purpose, especially business schools. We have way too many of those, and they should be bulldozed.\n\nIt has reached a point whereby you would even say it has become dull. Although, I find it interesting that my usual life motto being that discipline is key to life, and that having too much freedom has the opposite effect of trapping you within your many fleeting desires, drawing parallels here. School is exactly that. When everything is a choice for the sake of being a choice. Added to the fact that level of difficulty really is something to brush off. And most importantly, there is no consequence.\n\nSure, failure should be accepted but to a point. When there is no consequence to failing, and the societal acceptance of which leads me to believe that it creates uninspiring, ill-disciplined, weak-willed, social-confirming *individuals*. Strong words. And I can eat them later on (comment if you want). At the same time, it really does depends on the individual himself doesn't it? Still, a lot can be said about the environment required to nurture said individual.\n\nDuring the budding years, people learn laterally, parents have less of an impact on their children than you might think, especially in terms of how they learn. The question of whether it is required to change the status quo or not depends on whether the society wants to facilitate that change which depends if it is necessary to their eyes. Need meets want.\n\nI digress.\n\nPhotography wise, still nothing for now. But I did receive my SX-70, and have taken a few shots on it, two failures so far but that is just how it is with analogue. The rest turned out pretty good. Definitely a conversation starter, perhaps also a decent-ish parting gift for having their portraits taken. Possibilities are endless.\n\nWell, I guess I have taken more on my phone than anything else I suppose (*the best camera is the one you have with you at that time that you need to take a photo*). Which leads me to a point about getting a really good compact camera. Now you see a pattern here. As much as I would like to bring my Leica around, the place is not dynamic enough. It is not alive as I would like it to be. Everything is same-y. Then again, if I constantly have to justify my actions (*don't get me wrong, everyone should)*, nothing gets done.\n\nSo a little *\"folj med strömmen\"* should be good.\n\nThen again, that is probably me with G-A-S.\n\nWith a serious case of ennui.","src/content/muses/2018-05-01-the-fourth.mdx","423bedeb7e9dd200","the-fifth",{"id":325,"data":327,"body":336,"filePath":337,"digest":338,"deferredRender":22},{"title":328,"tags":329,"author":16,"description":330,"image":331,"pubDate":334,"updatedDate":335},"The Fifth",[9],"No, not in reference to a particular amendment in the American constitution.",{"src":332,"alt":333,"positionx":261,"positiony":277},"https://cdn.erfianugrah.com/tenhult_lake.jpg","fifth_1",["Date","2018-06-01T10:10:36.000Z"],["Date","2020-04-11T08:46:40.000Z"],"No, not in reference to a particular amendment in the American constitution.\n\nWhen the days start to amalgamate, you begin to think about whether the days you have lived were *lived* or were they just remnants of a past dream experienced by another version of you in a different space, and in a different time.\n\nThere is a story by a Chinese philosopher, Chuang-Tzu, called The Butterfly Dream (it serves as an allegory for the point that I was making, if there was any point at all, as usual):\n\n\"Once upon a time, I, Chuang-Tzu, dreamt I was a butterfly, fluttering hither and thither, to all intents and purposes a butterfly. I was conscious only of my happiness as a butterfly, unaware that I was Chuang-Tzu. Soon I awakened, and there I was, veritably myself again. Now I do not know whether I was then a man dreaming I was a butterfly, or whether I am now a butterfly, dreaming I am a man. Between a man and a butterfly there is necessarily a distinction. The transition is called the transformation of material things.\"\n\nThis talks about the distinction between illusion and reality, that we can never be sure we are actually awake. We think we might have but we really might have not been. I suppose, when one stops to think about why we do the things that we do, how we live day in and day out, how we do things for the sake of doing them, or to conform - it is not surprising that differentiating the two can be difficult.\n\nThat is not to say currently we do not know whether the dreams that we dream about are real or not, or whether that the reality that we live in is real or not. This is more to talk about the things that we do day to day. At least, in my own interpretation or usage of this allegory, when one cannot differentiate one thing from the other.\n\nBut, I digress.\n\nIt has inevitably come to an end. Perhaps earlier than was hoped to be however any decision to prolong it would be unsound when the reciprocity is unmet. The consequence of which has resulted in my wasting away. I have thought about this perennially, even if I came to the conclusion that it would be a fool's errand, the hope that is there is not lost even when there is none.","src/content/muses/2018-06-01-the-fifth.mdx","08db9fcea8b94f5b","the-seventh",{"id":339,"data":341,"body":351,"filePath":352,"digest":353,"deferredRender":22},{"title":342,"tags":343,"author":16,"description":344,"image":345,"pubDate":349,"updatedDate":350},"The Seventh",[9],"Iteration or evolution.",{"src":346,"alt":347,"positionx":277,"positiony":348},"https://cdn.erfianugrah.com/iteration_1.jpg","seventh_1","60%",["Date","2018-08-01T14:55:23.000Z"],["Date","2019-09-15T10:17:53.000Z"],"Iteration or evolution.\n\nI find myself thinking about whether humans are capable of influencing change in themselves. Do we change as people or do the actions themselves change? Would the actions represent us as a individuals capable of conscious thought and effort, or is it separate? Perhaps one way to look at it is the perennial conversation about separating who the artist is as a person and the art that is created. Action and person is separated. In a way.\n\nWhy I said whether I have iterated upon myself or whether I have evolved pertains to this. Evolution means that I am entirely different being. Whereas iteration means that I have created a new shell around this core being that is myself. I have dictated some changes towards the actions or reactions that I do on a daily basis. Perhaps, a lot of the things that I do has changed, this includes the kind of art that I indulge in and occasionally create but to say that I have changed might be an egregious error on my part.\n\nI have talked about how we exist within a spectrum of being and this adds on to that idea that we are never really changing but just switching between the multitude of selves, just multifaceted people with evolving actions and habits that we exert upon the world. The intentions, the thought process, the process in itself might not be any different. That is not to say evolution is not possible but it is highly unusual, as far as I can tell.\n\nChange does not just happen, and change is uncomfortable. It takes time. Which is why educating children about ideas and concepts would be a lot easier than say, an adult. But at the same time, it is not about the age (it is the common denominator) but it is about the accumulation of things \"I know\".\n\nLeading this back, I never liked talking about specifics unless it pertains to my photography (well, not going to start now either). Things are moving along and \"evolving\" as it moves along. As it is highly dependent on the subjects that I choose to shoot with, the process and outcomes become disparate. Which is both intended and at the same time posing a problem, a rather big one, with coherence and consistency.\n\nSince I intend to create a zine, it is dawning upon me that it might not just be one. There is a consistent theme throughout but at the same time the unique quirks to each might just not make it possible to make one (with some semblance of consistency or a theme). Once I start churning out the images and laying them out then I should be able to see how I can arrange them. Sequencing might be the trickiest part yet.\n\nThere are some months left to consolidate before the end of the project, and I would have to do that soon. There are a few more subjects to be shot however I do not know if I should get more or not.

At the same time, I believe that people, you and I, as individuals (that's an oxymoron-ic idea in the same sentence) exist infinitely in a finite spectrum of being. Who is to say this person that you are in the past, now and would be in the future is you or is not you? What is the \"core\" version of you? Is anything really that is set in stone? To think you know something or someone, is the surest way to blind yourself from learning about them, or yourself.\n\nBut I digress. As always.\n\nThings are falling into place like jigsaw (yes, Radiohead reference). Almost every aspect of my life is progressing. You can say (so far) things are taking a turn for me. In retrospection, should I talk to \"me\" from 6 months ago or even 10 months ago, I would be glad to say that a lot has changed, for the better (subjective). Of course, there would always be lapses. But they are few and far in between now, and when they do happen, they are not as intense as they used to be.\n\nPost-hoc rationalisation working its charm. It takes time, certainly. We tend to think we are rational people, that after a certain age, we are adults. See. Being an adult is a state of mind. Not about your age, not about what you do, the people you associate with or the social status that you are born with and any other superficial or material factors.\n\nIt is about the thought process, the principles you hold fast, the way you relate to other people, to societal cues and norms. Simply put, to really be able to think for yourself without getting too affected by the environment. Sure, we will get affected either way. But as adults (I would say) you choose what you take in or not. Like the semi-permeable membrane of the cell. Unless you're a plant, then you have the cell wall, nothing gets in. I think. (correct me if I'm wrong, biologists)\n\nThe portrait series is trudging along nicely. A whole slew of individuals are lined up to get shot *hah*. Someone asked to buy some prints of my work, which I have not gotten to yet because the funds are non-existent. But that might change this coming week (I guess not, maybe next week). Exciting stuff is going to happen, exciting because I make it so. When you water the plant regularly, tend to the salinity and alkaline/acidity levels of the soil, the nutrients and the sunlight it requires. When it blooms, it is hard work paid off right? The final flourish. The great pay off.\n\nIt all boils down (me and my soup analogies) to discipline. Which is will, consistency and the presence of mind to do what needs to be done, regardless of the environmental, physical and psychological ailments that might be affecting you.\n\n> “I wish it need not have happened in my time,\" said Frodo. \n>\n> \"So do I,\" said Gandalf, \"and so do all who live to see such times.

Grasping, floating around like flotsam and jetsam of a wrecked ship stripped layer by layer.\n\nIt has afforded me a rather costly perspective, I have yet to process all of it, and will probably take quite a bit of time to ruminate each moment that has so easily slipped my hands. The aspect of how unprepared I was, a kind of blitzkrieg of situations that left me in a state of discombobulation. \n\nWhat I do know is that it was (or still is) real, and that in many ways have veered me away from the path that I have set myself on, in terms of the mentality and physicality. I have thought about how easy for humans to forget and have been in that state sporadically, but such was the fury of which my mind has chosen to perceive that I am not immune as much as I like to think that I am. \n\nAs intensely negative as all that sounds, it is quite the opposite. Such an event would not have occurred would it not for the adaptive changes that I have made over the years to the core self. That is not to say that the entirety of which had been a markedly positive experience. There are aspects of bitterness and regret - only so due to the fleeting nature of these moments in time. The desperation, and I would say onslaught of emotions against the usual stability of my compartmentalised mind. \n\nI do not know if this would pass, it seems to be something with more permanence - a state of a new normal would have to be attained in the foreseeable future. I am not sure hope should be in the equation. But I suppose as I have alluded to in the beginning, it is just the perceived sense of control. \n\nErraticism is not all bad.","src/content/muses/2019-09-06-verganglich.mdx","59a36a3eee0ef8e2","sisyphean",{"id":455,"data":457,"body":467,"filePath":468,"digest":469,"deferredRender":22},{"title":458,"tags":459,"author":16,"description":460,"image":461,"pubDate":465,"updatedDate":466},"Sisyphean",[9],"It started with an idea or rather an intention to create something but certain things never come to light.

Or rather in our attempt to keep it in the shadows, it would still be inadvertently found. I guess if and when this does go out, that would probably be an ironic statement to start off with.\n\n---\n\nWhat has transpired since the last time I was here? A lot has and at the same time, nothing much has. Time seemed to have stopped for a while, it is  feeling that I do not enjoy. The *quality* vs. *quantity* argument, in that sense *a lot* has happened, I suppose.\n\nThere has been some changes, which brings us here to a state of introspection. I must say the language is not as well thought out, and poetic as they were before. I really have fallen off it for a while now, I just have to write more of these.\n\nWhat inspired me to write again? I suppose this draft has been nagging at me, a little thorn in my side. And each time I would start something I would just as swiftly wipe the slate clean. Starting over, again and again. Each time I would write something with minor differences, iterations upon iterations.\n\nWould this time make a difference? I think not, it would however be a mish-mash of past ideas and past dreams. So even in a state of apparent completion it would just be an aggregation of incomplete attempts. Perhaps it would survive deletion this time. Or just remain in limbo.\n\n---\n\nUnfortunately, much of the time *has* been in limbo, in a way you can reference the allegory of the cave, just as you are watching life pass you by. Every attempt to gain control is akin to grasping at your reflection on the water's surface - only momentarily interrupting with refractions, a rather rebellious attempt at gaining control only to resume that state normalcy that you find oh so abhorrent, yet again.\n\nSo then why continue at this seemingly frenetic pace or at times, time itself seems to stand still, days melding into days and you wonder about the progress you have sought out for yourself. Was the *goal* ever a reality? Or was the pursuit all is there to it?\n\nPerhaps *that* is all there is to it. Too big the scale of thought, or too minute makes the entirety of it pointless to ponder or discuss. The apparent lack of basis in reality creates a vacuum of self-indulgence. Why is that so bad, you might ask? Everyone has a different reality, or rather differing perceptions of  which they construe as a reality that they are living. \n\nI guess I would draw upon the concept of archetypes as opposed to stereotypes, and that of shared narratives. What we perceive as reality becomes wholly irrelevant when we take into consideration the most objective aspects of the act of living, that is, the interaction with the environment. \n\n---\n\nTaking that makes things a little bit clearer. As to why, I or probably any person who tries to exert control would end up in a relatively similar spot they were in before. The combination of time, place and probably a myriad other reasons intertwining creates the causality. But that in itself is ironic, and often those aspects of the environment are caused by other than itself, and you can go further back still.\n\nMaybe we should reconcile with the fact that we are all living in our own personal hamster wheels, *in perpetuum*.","src/content/muses/2020-12-23-sisyphean.mdx","653ca6320cc72c3c","pareidolia",{"id":470,"data":472,"body":481,"filePath":482,"digest":483,"deferredRender":22},{"title":473,"tags":474,"author":16,"description":475,"image":476,"pubDate":479,"updatedDate":480},"Pareidolia",[9],"There is no inherent underlying meaning in things we see and touch everyday.

It could also be books, the music you listen to or even white noise or artefacts in a particular recording of a particular song. Perhaps I am stretching the definition somewhat but we do tend to seek patterns or meaning in things that may or may not actually exhibit anything \"meaningful\" about them (depends on what you deem as meaningful, i.e. the philosophies, religions you subscribe to).\n\nI think this is a good thing.\n\nDoing anything for its own sake, in my opinion, makes for the most genuine form of purpose you can give yourself. You can think of: &ldquo;Why do anything, if not for fun?&rdquo;. It does not take away the merits of such an endeavour that you choose to take on (whatever those merits that you have applied to it) but instead enhances it. For there is no external factor but itself. This is, dare I say, pure.\n\nIt is classically human to look for meaning - a higher purpose if you will. There are a lot of unknowns and we want to make sense of it. You can say that it is fear at the most basic level. I do not think that either approach is necessarily superior to the other.

That being said would I be fine with selling my body in a more direct way than I already do now? Probably not (because of the aforementioned reasons). Though I would be hypocritical to think that the extent of the energy expenditure for remuneration is not dissimilar. Oftentimes, I would think to myself; who am I doing this for, and for what?\n\nWhen there's a need, there will be someone or something that comes along to fill that gap. I plug that gap in the way that I do, with flex tape. Others do it in their own way, and each person (although at the end, outcomes are pretty much indistinguishable) take different paths, and each path may take varying amounts of time to finish. Does finishing the work faster equate to better remuneration? And if you're paid the same anyway (same role), why work harder? For the potential of a promotion perhaps, or respect from your colleagues. Motivations differ.\n\nBut I digress. \n\nI started thinking about this more. The sense of identity one would have when they have a job. You are spending at least $\\frac{1}{3}$ of your adult working life doing just that. It has to have some meaning, a greater purpose if you will, in some sense, right? Why else would certain professions demand more \"respect\" than others? There is the money, and money can bring prestige, and then there's just the prestige, which could also bring other benefits, by way of reputation, which could then lead back to more money.\n\nI suppose this train of thought does dwell in the anarchist chasm, depending on what you subscribe to philosophically, there are _positive_ ways to look at this, just that I think sometimes it's a little bit too much _copium_ that we are pumping directly into our arteries, about the agency that we think we have.","src/content/muses/2025-05-24-commodification.mdx","f748e06c8a39e57d","short_form",["Map",501,502,518,519,532,533,546,547],"hypnagogia",{"id":501,"data":503,"body":515,"filePath":516,"digest":517,"deferredRender":22},{"title":504,"tags":505,"author":16,"description":507,"image":508,"pubDate":513,"updatedDate":514},"Hypnagogia",[506],"short form","The perception of time has changed for me, rather drastically in fact.

A combination of intellectual and emotional stimulus.\n\n---\nimport MasonryLayout from '../../../components/Masonry.astro';\n\n\u003CMasonryLayout images={[\n    { src: \"https://cdn.erfianugrah.com/Theo_1.JPG\", alt: \"Theo 1\" },\n    { src: \"https://cdn.erfianugrah.com/Theo_2.JPG\", alt: \"Theo 2\" },\n    { src: \"https://cdn.erfianugrah.com/Theo_3.JPG\", alt: \"Theo 3\" },\n]} />","src/content/long_form/gleichgesinnte/2018-12-25-theo.mdx","a0142872be5a18fe","zeitweilig",["Map",752,753],"what-is-erfi",{"id":752,"data":754,"body":764,"filePath":765,"digest":766,"deferredRender":22},{"title":755,"tags":756,"author":757,"description":758,"image":759,"pubDate":762,"updatedDate":763},"The Study of Erfinism",[750],"Lena","The discipline of Erfinism is a relatively young field of studies, first established in 1994 in Singapore.",{"src":760,"alt":761,"positionx":261,"positiony":277},"https://cdn.erfianugrah.com/120-221109-0003.jpg","zeitweilig_1",["Date","2022-06-03T06:06:06.000Z"],["Date","2024-08-12T10:24:49.000Z"],"import { Code } from 'astro:components';\nimport since94 from '../../scripts/since94.js';\n\n# Exposé for a PhD thesis\n\n**Working title: What is Erfi?**\n\nField research conducted by Lena\n\n## **Preface**\n\nThe discipline of Erfinism\u003Csup>1\u003C/sup> is a relatively young field of studies, first established in 1994 in Singapore. Even after {since94()} years since its foundation, there are no known experts in the field as of yet due to the sheer complexity of its nature.\n\nThe author of this exposé would like to establish herself as a respected scholar of Erfinism by attempting to narrow down on possible answers to the central question of \"What is Erfi?\". For this, the author conducted both personal field research as well as close monitoring of various test subjects that were brought into contact with the Erfi.\n\nThe completed PhD dissertation shall include a list of common linguistic Erfinisms and a “Robo Manual” with the most important guidelines to handle the Erfi. While aiming for an eradication of \"the Erfi effect\"\u003Csup>2\u003C/sup> would be nothing but delusional, this research project might provide helpful resources in terms of lowering the risk of lasting psychological damage for people trying to get into closer contact with the Erfi.\n\nThe author is well aware of the fact that a dedication to the study of Erfinism is a never-ending work in progress and therefore pledges to forever preserve the mindset of a padawan – a padawan hoping for a PhD title.\n\n\u003Csup>1\u003C/sup>*Erfinism can refer to both the overall study of the Erfi – hereby centered around the driving question of “What is Erfi?” – as well as the Erfi’s linguistic peculiarities.*\n\n\u003Csup>2\u003C/sup>*Definition to be found in the following chapter.*\n\n---\n\n*Disclaimer: Not in line with a traditional exposé structure, the following paragraphs provide a brief outline of the possible contents of a dissertation in Erfinism.*\n\n## Research Set-Up\n\nOver the past 1.5 years of field study, numerous test subjects got into touch with the Erfi. The common denominator between these guinea pigs has been their reaction towards this intense experience.\n\nWhile the Erfi is equipped with high levels of charisma, it does not follow social norms in terms of conversation, but instead opts for a technique dubbed as \"going stabby on someone\". This tactic consists of:\n\n1. Wooing the test subject (optional step)\n\n2. Aiming for weak spots with direct conversational stabs in an attempt to uncover inconsistencies, provoke a reaction and/or get past the superficial and move on to deeper levels of connection.\u003Csup>3\u003C/sup>\n\nIn the vast majority of cases, a first encounter with the Erfi therefore proves to be of intimidating and/or challenging nature and the duration of the experiment largely depends on the ability of the subjects to deal with repeated stabs in a non-paggro manner. While many guinea pigs find themselves to be wooed by the intense levels of attention and charisma bestowed upon them (described as 'feeling truly *seen*') and therefore get attracted by the study of Erfinism (and to its professor), most end up dropping the challenge within weeks or mere days.\u003Csup>4\u003C/sup>\n\nIn academic circles this phenomenon is famously dubbed \"the Erfi effect\", a serious condition that can send the people affected by it into a deep state of psychological distress. Symptoms are not limited to but often include: a steep rise in passive-aggressive behavior, denial of facts and stress-induced escapism. In addition to this, majority of the victims show PTSD symptoms when presented pictures of highspeed trains.\n\nWhile nearly all test subjects have been lost to \"the Erfi effect\" at the point of the submission of this exposé, they still provided insights into the dynamics of the Erfi in interpersonal relations and thereby made a valuable contribution to science.\n\n\u003Csup>3\u003C/sup>*Sometimes it's also just done for funzies.*\n\n\u003Csup>4\u003C/sup>*The sensation of 'feeling truly seen' is only charming as long as the ugly parts are politely overlooked - but the Erfi sees it all.*\n\n## Definitions\n\nThe Erfi is a complex (human) being and as it is so often the case with matters that are difficult to grasp, there is the tendency to try to make sense of it by putting pre-existing simplifying labels on it.\n\nA selection of these labels shall be briefly outlined in the following paragraphs.\n\n### Not Quite Human\n\nOne of the Erfi's characteristic traits is an immensely high level of rationality, which can lead to the assumption that the Erfi can't be quite human, but must be a very well-programmed robot instead. An assumption that gets supported by the Erfi's frequent use of robo sounds (\"beep boop\") and robotic-sounding statements like these:\n\n> \"I think I should be mostly functional by tomorrow.\"\n>\n> \\- Erfi Anugrah, Feburary 17, 2021. In recovery from LASIK-surgery.*\n\nThe lifestyle of the Erfi is characterized by an inhuman seeming high level of efficiency and routine; spontaneity is carefully planned into the schedule. Activities get tracked and monitored for improvement. This is not limited to, but includes: working out (incl. heart rate), daily water intake, steps walked in a day. Health also gets monitored closely with frequent check-ups planned in to prevent possible future defects to the Erfi system.\n\nThe living area of the Erfi can be described as \"the robo cave\", an indoor space measuring approx. 9m\u003Csup>2\u003C/sup>, equipped with tech gear, cats and limited editions of all sorts. Household chores get partly taken care of by a vacuum robot named robo waifu, further feeding into the theory that the Erfi is in fact not human but a superior work of AI instead, enslaving lower-caste robots.\n\nThe robo cave functions as a charging station to the Erfi. It is also a workshop for all sorts of tech-tinkering which is mostly targeted towards customization and optimization of various processes in the life of the Erfi (repair of robo waifu / film scanner, smart home installation, router set-up, etc.). Although the Garmin pulse tracker of the Erfi shows spikes when presented with athletic bodies in well-fitting crop tops, the Erfi lights up most when presented with high-quality tech-gear, especially routers, further feeding into the robo theory.\n\n> “I’m like Daneel. More perfect than human. (Just short)”\n>\n> \\- Erfi Anugrah, March 22, 2021\n\nAn argument that might contradict the robo definition is the added human touch in form of empathy, flirts\u003Csup>5\u003C/sup> and general charisma. The question of whether the Erfi is a human being equipped with an incredibly stoic mindset or whether we are in fact dealing with superior AI hasn't been solved yet.\n\n\u003Csup>5\u003C/sup>*As human-seeming the flirty comments of the Erfi are, they tend to come up a tad too smooth and quickly, sowing the suspicion of a flirt-bot running its program.*\n\n### Stoic Opa\n\nAnother label that is frequently put on the Erfi is that of a grandpa.\n\nAt first glance, this might be fitting since the Erfi follows a sleeping schedule similar to that of an 80-year old: Going to bed at 9-10pm and getting up at 4.30 - 5am. Another trait that plays into the grandpa theory is the fact that the Erfi frequently scolds people and drops wisdom on them, either in the form of stoic-themed quotes (preferred sources: Dune, The Count of Monte Cristo) or personal musings, ending up in Erfi train-styled lectures. The Erfi does not hesitate to do this even when opposite people much older than himself since age alone is no indicator of maturity. Due to the \"get shit done - grindset\" - mentality of the Erfi, he gives off the impression of having lived more than one life already.\n\nWhile the Opa-label therefore seems to be a fitting one, it wouldn't include other stereotypical grandpa behavior such as feeding ducks in the park or playing bingo. If the Erfi were a grandpa, Logan from the HBO series Succession would be the most fitting comparison: An extremely powerful grandpa that has built up his kingdom from scratch, challenging his possible successors in the most machiavellian ways (and looking on in disdain as they fail him all), putting his principles over human relationships.\n\n### Stranger than Fiction\n\nAs unconventional of a person the Erfi may seem, there are some fictional characters that show similarities.\n\n> \"Rich, smart, fit, funny, good looking. I'm just Batman aren't I. Sigh.\"\n> \n> \\- Erfi Anugrah, December 9, 2021\n\nAt first glance, this label seems like a fitting one since both Batman and the Erfi fall into the category of Enneagram Type 1 personalities: perfectionists challenging the status quo, consistently striving towards an ideal with anger as the subconscious fuel that motivates them. Both Batman and the Erfi place immensely high standards on themselves. In the case of Batman, it goes into the direction of dedicating his life to keep Gotham safe, in the case of the Erfi those standards apply to self-optimization in all aspects of life. To some degree, this also includes the people the Erfi cares about, which can be perceived as overly critical and thereby result in a case of \"the Erfi effect\". To soften the impact of the crash with the approaching Erfi train, it is recommended to not see critique as an insult but rather as a form of care.\n\nDespite the similarities in their personalities, there's a major difference between the two of them: While Batman’s empire is built upon the legacy of his parents – both financially and in regards to the trauma associated with their deaths – the Erfi made it on its own. You could go so far as to say that the Erfi not only harbors a liking for various DIY-projects, but that the whole path of the Erfi is a DIY project of its own.\n\n> \"discipline baby.\"\n>\n> \\- Erfi Anugrah, June 8, 2021\n\nTherefore, a comparison to Edmond Dantes might be a more fitting one: Growing up in a restricting environment which gave fuel to the Erfis levels of discipline, driving him towards success, no matter the task. \n\n### ...So What IS Erfi?\n\nThe Erfi is a creature not easily described by the limiting quality of pre-existing labels. Even in the face of the many years filled with the study of Erfinism that are yet to come, it is unlikely that scholars will ever find a truly satisfying answer to the question of \"What is Erfi?\".\n\nPerhaps the image of a matroshka puppet would be most fitting: A never-ending series of boxes within boxes, only unlocked by sincere curiousity.\n\n> \"The closer we are to something (...) The less we see. Myopic is a good analogy for it. So we have to take a step back right?\" \n>\n> \\- Erfi Anugrah, Expression and Acceptance\n\nThere is always a certain level of uncertainty in regards to where the author - or anyone really - stands with the Erfi. It is a common misconception of scholars of Erfinism to assume they're being in too close of a distance to the Erfi already, which prompts them to take a few steps back to get the full view in. Lost in their ignorance, they might never notice they've been miles apart this whole time.\n\n...\n\nSince this exposé does not quite follow the structure of a common exposé and since the author runs danger of digressing too much by now, let's just go with another quote by the one and only: \n\n> \"Anyways, I digress. But what is there to digress from anyway, and who reads this shit?\" \n>\n> \\- Erfi Anugrah, Printing\n\n## Appendix\n\n#### *Robo Manual (draft)*\n\n- The robo is equipped with methods to detect all types of inconsistencies and bs. Don’t try to find a loophole. There is none. Never forget: This is some superior AI you're dealing with here.\n- There's no brake pedal to the Erfi train. There is no safe zone: The Erfi train lays its own tracks as it approaches.\n- Beware: High amounts of aggressiveness. Practice the skill of rowing back to seek for the source of an argument.\n- Match its weirdness to see the robo beam.\n- Frequent recharging time in the robo cave needed.\n- Do NOT touch anything in the robo cave.\n- Appropriate robo fuel (selection): Five Guys burgers, protein powder, good dosa, Lantchips, Lidl-Berliner, pizza, kanelbullar.\n- No additional supplies of caffeinated drinks. The system of the robo is running at high speeds on its own, caffeine should be dosed carefully since it can send its system into overdrive. Warning signs: hectic robo sounds in high frequency (\"bbrrrreeeeeeehhhh brrrboopbeepboopbeep\")\n- Don’t ask to ask – but ask! Curiousity switches the robo on.\n\n#### *Linguistic Peculiarities*\n\nExtensive field study unveiled a myriad of linguistic peculiarities characteristic of the Erfi, some of which are so distinct they can fall under the category of so-called “Erfinisms” (see list of selected quotes)\n\n### Robo sounds\n\n```\nBeep boop\n\nBrrrr beep \n\nbrbrbrbbr\n\nSkepticism / Probing for inconsistencies\n\n“Is it?”\n\n“sus”\n\n“Trust but verify”\n```\n\n### Slang\n\n```\n“This meshuggah album *fucks*”\n\n\"it's in my nature to trust and verify. *Yeet*\"\n\nThe ability to turn anything into\n  a self-compliment (which can’t be negated since it’s true)\n\n“i like your hands - i have nice hands. So i know how nice hands\n  should be.\"\n\n\"I'm more impressed at myself.\"\n\n(for further examples refer to the list of Erfinisms)\n\nSneking\n\n“buy buy”\n\n“heheheh”\n\n(accompanied by links to and/or\n  videos about various products)\n```\n\n### *Erfinisms (selected quotes)*\n\n```\n\"How am I single? It's by choice.\" (March 30, 2021)\n\n\"I robo for everyone. But where’s my thanks. No oil.\" (September 23, 2021)\n\n\"Yes I would see you die as long as I'm right. It justifies everything.\" (November 30, 2021)\n\n\"I should have a civil partnership. With myself.\" (December 9, 2021)\n\n\"I flirt and do stuff at the same time. Efficient.\" (December 11, 2021)\n\n\"Never use absolute terms. I can though.\" (April 4, 2022)\n\n“End of the day, it’s hard to live with God.” (April 24, 2022)\n\n“I’m a catalyst. Of Evil. Neyehehhe” (April 24, 2022)\n\n“I don’t care about anyone else but I need to be beyond doubt (...) it’s never me, always you” (May 6, 2022)\n\n\"God looking for servants\" (May 13, 2022)\n\n\"She needs a boat to cross the river. And I'll shoot it down. With incendiary arrows.\" (May 20, 2022)\n\n\"I think I give less of a fuck now. And I already give so little\" (May 30, 2022)\n```","src/content/zeitweilig/2022-06-03-what-is-erfi.mdx","8a7ae5002e8760e2","cv",["Map",769,770],"resume",{"id":769,"data":771,"body":938,"filePath":939,"digest":940,"deferredRender":22},{"title":16,"fullName":772,"sections":773,"tags":786,"author":16,"description":787,"pubDate":788,"updatedDate":789,"contacts":790,"skills":804,"languages":835,"education":849,"companies":862},"ERFI
